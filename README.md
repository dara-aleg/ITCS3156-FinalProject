## Analyzing and Predicting E-Commerce Using Machine Learning
#### By Dara Alegre
#### ITCS-3156 Final Project

## 📄 Abstract
This study leverages machine learning to predict which products are likely to become top sellers on an e-commerce platform. Using a dataset of approximately 80,000 products, it implements two classification algorithins like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, based on features such as price, discount rate, and product category. After addressing missing values, standardizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables, the models are trained 70% of the data, validated on 10%, and tested on the remaining 20%. The results indicate that the Random Forest model achieves higher accuracy than Logistic Regression, particularly in identifying top-selling products. Key characteristics associated with best sellers indicate lower prices less than $25, higher discounts above 15%, and specific categories like Home & Kitchen. These insights can guide strategies for pricing, promotions, and product assortment, helping businesses better understand consumer purchasing patterns and optimize their sales approaches.
